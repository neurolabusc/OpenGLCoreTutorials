# OpenGLCoreTutorials

##### About

The tag line of Lazarus is "write once, compile anywhere", allowing developers to rapidly develop software for Linux, MacOS and Windows. However, developing OpenGL applications represents a challenge, as MacOS [drops deprecated features](http://renderingpipeline.com/2012/04/sad-state-of-opengl-on-macos-x/) from OpenGL (the **core** profile). Therefore, to support all three major desktop platforms one must either target OpenGL 2.1 (the last legacy version supported by MacOS, with GLSL version 1.2) or OpenGL 3.3 **core** [MacOS 10.7 introduced OpenGL 3.2 (GLSL 1.5) while recent versions support from 3.3(3.3)-4.1(4.1)](https://developer.apple.com/opengl/capabilities/)). This is unlike Linux and Windows, where the drivers support the legacy OpenGL features (so you can mix and match modern functions with deprecated functions).

There are nice [tutorials for legacy OpenGL](http://wiki.freepascal.org/OpenGL_Tutorial). However, those tutorials describe many features that do not exist in the core specification (e.g. GL_QUADS, glVertex3f, GL_MODELVIEW). The three tutorials below illustrate how to write modern OpenGL applications. A nice feature of Core OpenGL is that it is very similar to the OpenGL ES versions used by many phones and tablets.

##### Compiling

The three sample applications should compile easily (assuming you are using Lazarus 1.6.2 or later): launch Lazarus and choose Project/OpenProject and select your project (basic, cubepro or render), then select Run/Run to compile and execute the project. However, there is one wrinkle for MacOS users: Lazarus uses the Carbon widgetset by default, but you must use the Cocoa widgetset to exploit OpenGL core. To change the widgetset, select Project/ProjectOptions, select the "Additions and Overrides" tab and click the LCLWidgetType pull-down to select "Cocoa" (or you can select the MacOS configuration, as shown in the image below). Once you do this, the applications should compile easily.

##### Project 1: Basic

The project basic.lpr shows a 2D square. It is a Pascal port of a minimal [C project](https://github.com/skeeto/opengl-demo). You can drag the mouse to spin the square. Since Core OpenGL does not support GL_QUADS, we draw the square using a [GL_TRIANGLE_STRIP](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16882474/is-there-a-clear-performance-difference-between-gl-quads-and-gl-triangle-strip). This project was also ported to legacy OpenGL 2.1 (basicLegacy project).

##### Project 2: Cube

The project cubepro.lpr shows a colored 3D cube. You can drag the mouse to spin the cube. Since Core OpenGL does not support GL_MODELVIEW and GL_PROJECTIONVIEW, this project uses equivalent functions (nGL_MODELVIEW and nGL_PROJECTIONVIEW) from the unit gl_core_utils. This project was also ported to legacy OpenGL 2.1 (cubeLegacy project).

##### Project 3: Render

The project render.lpr create volume renderings - by default it generates a 'borg' cube, but you can load any NIfTI format image, for example the brain image included with this project. This project is a simple extension of the cube project: note that the colors of the cube in the previous project map their XYZ position as red, green and blue. We can use these 3 dimensions to map the three dimensions of our 3D textures.

Volume renderers are often [two pass, but can also be computed in a single pass](http://prideout.net/blog/?p=64). This project can be compiled for either mode, depending on whether the compiler directive '{$DEFINE TWO_PASS}' is enabled or not. There is no  meaningful performance difference between these two modes (the single pass eliminates a 2D texture lookup per ray, but for complex volumes we are computing hundreds of 3D texture lookups). However, the single pass method is simpler to implement as you do not need to manage a framebuffer for the cube's back face.

I have a similar Lazarus project that uses [legacy OpenGL 2.1](https://github.com/neurolabusc/vx) instead of OpenGL Core 3.3.

##### Project 4: Textures

The project tex.lpr loads two textures (fish and coral). Dragging the mouse re-positions the fish, and using the scroll wheel adjusts the size of the fish. This project was also ported to legacy OpenGL 2.1 (texLegacy project).

##### Project 5: Smooth Fonts (aka multi-channel signed distance fonts)

The project mtext.lpr draws text on the screen. Since OpenGL is specialized for drawing triangles, it is surprisingly hard to create nice text (which tends to exhibit smooth curves). This project uses [distance field fonts](http://www.valvesoftware.com/publications/2007/SIGGRAPH2007_AlphaTestedMagnification.pdf) using an advanced multi-channel technique described by [Viktor Chlumsk√Ω](https://github.com/Chlumsky/msdfgen). In addition to the included font, you can generate your own using a simple [javascript program](https://github.com/Jam3/msdf-bmfont). This project generates both a conventional single channel (top) as well as a multichannel (bottom) fonts so you can see the difference. This is also provided in legacy OpenGL (textmLegacy).

##### Project 6: Color Intensity Scales

The project clrbar.lpr generates color bars with text legends. It builds off of the font project. Like the font project, static features are rapidly drawn using a vertex buffer (or a display list if you use legacy OpenGL) rather than being regenerated. As a bonus, an analogous project clrbarLegacy.lpr is included that shows the same technique using legacy OpenGL (2.1), whereas the main project requires OpenGL 3.3.

##### GTK3 Notes

The GTK3 widgetset only supports the [OpenGL Core Profile and they will never add legacy profiles support to GTK3](https://www.bassi.io/articles/2015/02/17/using-opengl-with-gtk/). Therefore, the tutorials in this repository are particularly relevant to GTK3 developers. Another quirk is that GTK3 encapsulates the frame buffer. In contrast, with other widgetsets, framebuffer 0 is always the visible screen. Therefore, projects that call [glBindFramebuffer(GL_FRAMEBUFFER, 0) will not update the screen](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47613181/opengl-strange-framebuffer-behavior-with-gtk-gl-area).
